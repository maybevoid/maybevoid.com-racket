 @a['href: "https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe"]{@code{Maybe}} is an
 @a['href: "https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type"]{algebraic data type (ADT)} in
 @a['href: "https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell"]{Haskell} to express a type whose value
 may be @a['href: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type"]{absence}.
 @a['href: "https://hackage.haskell.org/package/void-0.6.1/docs/Data-Void.html"]{@code{Void}}
 is a special type in Haskell representing nothingness. @code{Void} has no inhabitant
 and corresponds to falsehood in logic.
}
            @p{
 When @code{Maybe} is parameterized with @code{Void},
 it expands into @code{Just Void | Nothing}.
 But @code{Nothing} is really a @a['href: "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/unit+type"]{Unit} type
 @code{()} with one inhabitant @code{()}. The type can be re-expressed as @code{Either Void ()},
 indicating that @code{Maybe Void} is really a
 @a['href: "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sum+type"]{sum type} of @code{Void} or @code{()}.
}
            @p{
 With the @a['href: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence"]{Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence},
 we can rewrite the expression with more generalized symbol
 @code{@b{0} + @b{1}}, which does exactly the same thing as elementary school algebra
 and we are left with the top type @code{@b{1}}, or just @code{()} in Haskell.
